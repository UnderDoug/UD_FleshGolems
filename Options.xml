      The base odds that the {{UD_FleshGolems_reanimated|Reanimated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} reanimatable entity.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      When this otion is set to 100, there is a 1 in 100 chance that the builder will be applied to an entity when it is created.

      If this option is set to 1, {{Y|every entity}} that can spawn reanimated will spawn renaimated.

      Set this option to {{W|0}} to {{w|disable}} the builder override (default rate for reanimated entities is 1 in 8000).

      The default is {{W|0}}.

      The odds multiplier that the {{UD_FleshGolems_reanimated|Reanimated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} reanimatable entity.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      This option multiplies the base odds, so if the base odd are 100, and this option is set to 100, there is a 1 in 10,000 chance that an entity will be reanimated as it spawns.

      The default rate (set by this mod) for reanimated entities is 1 in 8000 and is rolled entirely separately, so consider that 1 in 8000 twice is twice as likely when choosing this option.

      Set this option to {{W|1}} to {{w|disable}} multiplying the odds.

      The default is {{W|1}}.

      The base odds that the {{nanoneuro|Animated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} corpse.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      When this otion is set to 100, there is a 1 in 100 chance that the builder will be applied to a corpse when it is created.

      If this option is set to 1, {{Y|every corpse}} that can spawn reanimated will spawn renaimated.

      Set this option to {{W|0}} to {{w|disable}} the builder override (default rate for animated corpses is 1 in 3000).

      The default is {{W|0}}.
