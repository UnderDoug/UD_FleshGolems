    <helptext>
      When enabled, the player will start each run with the mod's &quot;Test Kit&quot;, which is just a mutation with the ability to raise the dead at will (with the ability to force them to join you), summon random corpses, and assess corpses for what they might have been in life.
      
      This mutation is stupidly overpowered and shouldn't really be used to actually play with.

      The default is {{w|Disabled}}.

    <helptext>
      When a large number of corpses are {{UD_FleshGolems_reanimated|endlessly suffering}} at once it can have quite a big impact on performance, since each turn each corpse rolls to take damage and then rolls to leak some gunk nearby.
      
      When enabled the chance for any of these rolls to succeed is 2 orders of magnitude lower (divided by 100), which is significantly more performant.

      The base odds that the {{UD_FleshGolems_reanimated|Reanimated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} reanimatable entity.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      When this otion is set to 100, there is a 1 in 100 chance that the builder will be applied to an entity when it is created.

      If this option is set to 1, {{Y|every entity}} that can spawn reanimated will spawn renaimated.

      Set this option to {{W|0}} to {{w|disable}} the builder override (default rate for reanimated entities is 1 in 8000).

      The default is {{W|0}}.

      The odds multiplier that the {{UD_FleshGolems_reanimated|Reanimated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} reanimatable entity.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      This option multiplies the base odds, so if the base odd are 100, and this option is set to 100, there is a 1 in 10,000 chance that an entity will be reanimated as it spawns.

      The default rate (set by this mod) for reanimated entities is 1 in 8000 and is rolled entirely separately, so consider that 1 in 8000 twice is twice as likely when choosing this option.

      Set this option to {{W|1}} to {{w|disable}} multiplying the odds.

      The default is {{W|1}}.

      The base odds that the {{nanoneuro|Animated}} builder will be applied to {{Y|every}} corpse.

      This option works {{G|immediately}}.

      When this otion is set to 100, there is a 1 in 100 chance that the builder will be applied to a corpse when it is created.

      If this option is set to 1, {{Y|every corpse}} that can spawn reanimated will spawn renaimated.

      Set this option to {{W|0}} to {{w|disable}} the builder override (default rate for animated corpses is 1 in 3000).

      The default is {{W|0}}.
