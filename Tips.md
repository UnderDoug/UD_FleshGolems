# Getting The Most Out Of The Mod
Quick little guide on getting to see the bulk of what the mod has to offer.

## Immediate

### Starting Pet
Start with the starting pet "corpse of Jofo Qudwufo", who is a reanimated snapjaw with a bit of custom dialogue and a hint pointing at more of the mod's content.

### Options
Under the catergory "Mod: Re-animatable Corpses" There are 4 options that let the player dynamically fiddle with the "Reanimated" and "Animated" builders. Each builder has a base ChanceOneIn and multiplier. The lower the numbers the more likely they are to be applied, with 0 disabling them altogether.

It's entirely possible to play as a reanimated player in this way. You'll keep your starting attributes (these are modified slightly to account for your new physical state), mutations, skills, and cybernetics.

### Wishes
`UD_FleshGolems reanimated <blueprint>` will spawn a reanimated version of whatever you specified, if it's reanimatable (replace `<blueprint>` wholly with the creature's blueprint).
- Leaving the blueprint out _should_ make the player into a reanimated corpse, but gives you the option to back out if the intention was to specify one.

`UD_FleshGolems go Mad Monger` will whisk you away to the lair of the Mad 'Monger, revealing the secret location in the process.

`UD_FleshGolems Mad Monger` will spawn the Mad 'Monger, who is the main quest NPC for the mod. They'll be findable out in the world, but can be spawned in to see their thousands of words of unique dialogue.

The Mad 'Monger reacts to the player's genotype and morphotype, so you'll need to play as all 4 of: true kin, chimera, esper, and plain-ol' mutant to get the whole picture. He won't tell any single one of them the whole story.

`UD_FleshGolems debug quest corpses` will spawn 3 of each of the corpses that the Mad 'Monger has requested, in a 2 cell radius around the player, allowing you to shortcut through the quest, get the rewards, and see out the quest's dialogue.

There will be more steps to the Mad 'Monger's quest in the future, we just ran a little short of time before the deadline.

## Through Play

### Corpse Animated Spawn Chance
Corpses can just spawn animated, including after something is killed.

### Spray-A-Brain & Nano-Neuro Animator
Corpses can be animated in much the same way as other animatable objects. Corspes you reanimate can be recruited for reputation without having to water ritual them.

### Find The Mad 'Monger
Trade secrets to find the location of the Mad 'Monger, a self-aggrandizing misanthrope with more than a whole chip on his shoulder, who needs your help procuring some strange materials for the "science" he's doing.

He's also a traditional gutsmonger who restocks and sells cybernetics but also pulls from an additional table with Limb-Loot™ Boxes®! These special limbs are implanted with a random cybernetic that can be butchered from them.
