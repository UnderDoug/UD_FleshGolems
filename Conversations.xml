        Why if it isn't the meat that fancies itself nobility.~
        Do you have to have all of those machines implanted, they make perfoming vivisections so annoying.~
        Does the rare meat wish to purchase more meat? Perhaps there's a goodie or two you could use.~ 
        You'd be better served 'becoming' my test subject. 
  
      <Text if Chimera
        Your biology is so......unstable, fasinating.~
        May I have a limb or two, you can surely spare at least one.~
        So much material to work with!!!~
        Would you like to purchase a snack, gargantuan meat? There must be something here to your liking. 
  
      <Text if Esper
        Grey meat, the second worst kind, so little viable material.~  
        When your mind is inevitably consumed by sights older than sight, may I have your remains?~  
        Would you like to purchase something? Perhaps it can provide comfort while you cower away from Ptoh's gaze.~  
        One wrong step and I activate my normalitly field.
  
       <Text if mutant
        Salutations meat.~ 
        May I have your legs? I promise to return them.~ 
        Would you kindly lay upon this table here, I assure you that it is entirly safe.~ 
        Would you like to purchase something meat?
