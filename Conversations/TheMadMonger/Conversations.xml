        The walking relic wants to help me replace it, how grand. Very well rare meat, there is actually something you could do to assist.

        My current experimentation with forcibly installing cybernetic augments into walking corpses has yielded little fruit, with a few exceptions, nearly all of the corpses I tested rapidly dissolved into viscera.

        However, certain corpses took longer to lose integrity than others, I would like you to gather some of these 'implant-tolerant' cadavers.

        I need the most resistant material available for my next round of experiments. I require 3 corpses out of this list, (random creature list of 10 goes here), find these creatures, kill them and then bring me what remains.

        Why yes there is, prime meat. Your gargantuan form should be well-suited to this task.

        My current experimentation with forcibly augmenting walking corpses has largely failed.
        Barring a small number of exceptions, nearly every live corpse I augmented rapidly dissolved into paste.

        While every attempt did eventually end in abject failure, a tiny minority of corpses survived longer than the others before liquefying.

        I would like you to bring me some of these implant-tolerant cadavers. I am going to change my approach and require the most resistant material available

        I require three corpses out of this list, (list of 10 random creatures goes here) find the appropriate creatures, kill them and bring me what is left.

        My current line of experimentation has a hit a wall more resilient than the cage of your winged-predators' master.

        Nearly every single corpse I have tried to augment has instantly dissolved into paste, I wish to try a new approach and require additional material to do so.

        This list contains a series of creatures which through previous experiments I've found are slightly more resistant to the liquefying effects of augmentation, I would like you to locate three of these creatures, kill them and then bring the rotting husks to me for testing.

        Upon completion of this task, I will provide you with a suitable reward.

        If by 'work' you mean making revolutionary strides in the field of cybernetics then yes, I have work for you meat.

        I know you are mediocrity made form so I'll try to keep this simple. I need more material for my experiments, all my previous attempts to augment reanimated corpses has ended in failure.

        I require stronger material, this list contains a total number of 10 possible targets. I need you to retrieve the corpses of 3. How you do so is irrelevant, all that matters is that I have the meat I require.

        Once you have completed this paltry task I will grant you a suitable reward.

        What is pain besides another word for progress. With the power of my vast genius I found a way to bypass those damned restrictions on one of the many millennium-old chrome surgeons scattered throughout this land.

        I however didn't anticipate that my very physiology would reject augmentation, though it's irrelevant, I will find a way, no matter how much material it takes!!

      <text IfHavePart="Esper" Priority="1">
        You figure that out all by yourself? Why don't use your nigh-omniscient extra-sensory gaze to tell me more obvious things.

        The pain and instability are small prices to pay for my inevitable cybernetic ascension, though I suppose you wouldn't know the value of such a pursuit. Having a mind nearly as small as your body's capacity for mutation after all.

        Silence meat. I, and I alone, determine what is sick and what is healthy!

        Rare meat, yes, though rare may be a misnomer, I speak only in terms of the difficulty of finding materials like yours, not to the value that they provide; worthless meat may be a more accurate descriptor.

        Prime meat, yes, for your body is as ever-changing and adapting as my unfathomablely vast intellect, so much room for error too, so much excess material. You are the height of usefulness to me.

        Meat, yes, would you prefer I say materials, components, resources? You are a walking sack of things I find moderately useful. Be grateful I've decided not to harvest you for the time being.
